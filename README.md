# CAAL Tool Registry

Community-driven voice tools for [CAAL](https://github.com/CoreWorxLab/caal) - the voice assistant that actually does things. Part of the [CAAL Tool API](https://github.com/CoreWorxLab/caal/wiki/CAAL-Tool-API).

## What is this?

This registry contains **voice-first n8n workflows** that extend CAAL's capabilities. Unlike generic n8n templates, these are optimized for:

- Voice triggers (how you'd actually say it)
- Low latency (< 5 second responses)
- Conversational responses (not raw JSON)
- One-click installation

## Install a Tool

### From the CAAL Frontend (Recommended)

1. Open your CAAL web interface
2. Browse the Tool Registry
3. Click **Install** on any tool
4. Follow the setup prompts (credentials, service URLs)
5. CAAL auto-refreshes — start using your new tool immediately

### Manual Install

1. Download the `workflow.json` from the tool's folder
2. Import into n8n (Settings > Import from File)
3. Create required credentials (listed in the tool's README)
4. Update any service URLs
5. Activate the workflow
6. Tell CAAL to refresh: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8889/reload-tools`

## Tool Types

### Individual Tools
Single-purpose tools that do one thing well.
- Named: `service_action_object` (e.g., `truenas_get_status`)
- One workflow, one action

### Tool Suites
Multi-action tools that group related functionality.
- Named: `service` (e.g., `google_tasks`, `truenas`)
- One workflow, multiple actions via Switch node
- Actions like: get, add, complete, delete, control

**Example:** `google_tasks` suite handles:
- "What's on my task list?" → `action: get`
- "Add task buy groceries" → `action: add`
- "Mark done the groceries task" → `action: complete`

## Manifest Schema

Each tool has a `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-registry-id",
  "name": "google_tasks",
  "friendlyName": "Google Tasks",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Manage Google Tasks - get, add, complete, and delete tasks.",
  "category": "productivity",
  "toolSuite": true,
  "actions": ["get", "add", "complete", "delete"],
  "icon": "google_tasks.svg",
  "voice_triggers": [
    "What's on my task list?",
    "Add task buy groceries"
  ],
  "required_services": ["google tasks"],
  "required_credentials": [...],
  "required_variables": [...],
  "author": { "github": "username" },
  "tier": "community",
  "tags": ["productivity", "google"]
}
```

**Suite-specific fields:**
- `toolSuite`: `true` for suites, `false` for individual tools
- `actions`: Array of available actions (suites only)
- `friendlyName`: Human-readable display name
- `icon`: Optional icon filename (see `/icons/`)

## For CAAL Developers

CAAL can query this registry directly:

```python
import httpx

REGISTRY_INDEX = "https://registry.caal.io/index.json"

async def search_registry(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(REGISTRY_INDEX)
        tools = resp.json()

    query_lower = query.lower()
    return [t for t in tools if query_lower in t['name'] or query_lower in t['description'].lower()]
```
