# CAAL Tool Registry

Community-driven voice tools for [CAAL](https://github.com/CoreWorxLab/caal) - the voice assistant that actually does things.

---

> **🚧 Under Active Development**
> This registry is under active development. Core functionality works, but not all bugs have been worked out. Expect rough edges. Contributions and bug reports welcome!

## What is this?

This registry contains **voice-first n8n workflows** that extend CAAL's capabilities. Unlike generic n8n templates, these are optimized for:

- Voice triggers (how you'd actually say it)
- Low latency (< 5 second responses)
- Conversational responses (not raw JSON)
- One-click installation

## For CAAL Developers

CAAL can query this registry directly:

```python
import httpx

REGISTRY_INDEX = "https://registry.caal.io/index.json"

async def search_registry(query: str) -> list[dict]:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(REGISTRY_INDEX)
        tools = resp.json()

    query_lower = query.lower()
    return [t for t in tools if query_lower in t['name'] or query_lower in t['description'].lower()]
```
