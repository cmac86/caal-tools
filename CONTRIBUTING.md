# Contributing to CAAL Tool Registry

Thanks for contributing! This registry grows through community submissions.

## Submitting a Tool

### Quick Method (Recommended)

The intake script handles most of the work for you:

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caal-tools
cd caal-tools

# 2. Export your workflow from n8n (File > Download)

# 3. Run the intake script
node scripts/intake.js ~/Downloads/my-workflow.json

# 4. Answer the prompts:
#    - Category (select from menu)
#    - Variable names for any hardcoded URLs
#    - Voice trigger examples
#    - Service name

# 5. Review the generated files in tools/<category>/<tool-name>/

# 6. Validate
node scripts/validate.js tools/homelab/my-tool
node scripts/check-secrets.js tools/homelab/my-tool/workflow.json

# 7. Submit PR
git checkout -b add-my-tool
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my-tool"
git push origin add-my-tool
```

The intake script will:
- Detect and replace hardcoded IPs/URLs with variables
- Nullify credential IDs for portability
- Extract webhook description
- Generate manifest.json, workflow.json, and README.md
- Check for secrets (blocks if found)

### Manual Method (Advanced)

If you prefer full control or the intake script doesn't fit your workflow:

#### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/caal-tools
cd caal-tools
```

#### 2. Create Your Tool Directory

```bash
mkdir -p tools/media/my-awesome-tool
cd tools/media/my-awesome-tool
```

#### 3. Add Required Files

Copy from templates:

```bash
cp ../../../templates/workflow-template.json workflow.json
cp ../../../templates/manifest-template.json manifest.json
cp ../../../templates/readme-template.md README.md
```

#### 4. Build Your Workflow

1. Create and test your workflow in n8n
2. Export the workflow JSON
3. Replace any hardcoded URLs with `${VARIABLE_NAME}` placeholders
4. Ensure your webhook node has a description in the notes field
5. Enable MCP access: `"settings": { "availableInMCP": true }`

**Important:** The webhook description is what CAAL uses to understand what your tool does. Write it in plain English, include example phrases, and document the parameters.

Example webhook notes:
```
Gets the current price of a stock by ticker symbol.
User says: "what's the price of AAPL?"

Parameters:
- symbol (string, required): Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL)
```

#### 5. Fill Out the Manifest

Update `manifest.json` with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | kebab-case identifier (e.g., `jellyseerr-search`) |
| `description` | Voice-friendly description of what it does |
| `category` | One of: `smart-home`, `media`, `homelab`, `productivity`, `developer`, `utilities`, `sports`, `social`, `other` |
| `voice_triggers` | Array of example phrases (at least 2) |
| `required_services` | External services needed (e.g., `["jellyseerr"]`) |
| `required_credentials` | Credentials to create in n8n (see schema below) |
| `required_variables` | URLs or config values the user must provide |
| `author` | Your GitHub username |
| `tags` | Searchable keywords |

#### Credential Schema

Each credential in `required_credentials` must specify:

```json
{
  "credential_type": "githubApi",
  "name": "github_account",
  "description": "GitHub API"
}
```

Common credential types:
- `githubApi`, `slackApi`, `notionApi`, `googleApi`, `discordApi`, `homeAssistantApi`
- `httpHeaderAuth`, `httpBasicAuth`, `oAuth2Api`, `sshPassword`

Example for header auth:
```json
{
  "credential_type": "httpHeaderAuth",
  "name": "truenas_api",
  "description": "TrueNAS API key (Header Auth)"
}
```

#### Parameterization Notes (Recommended)

To help users configure your tool during installation, add guidance notes to nodes with user-specific values. This creates helper text that appears below input fields in the install modal.

**Format:**
```
PARAMETERIZE:
- fieldName: Brief description of what this value is
  Find: Where to locate this value in the service's UI
  Default: "optional default" (if applicable)
```

**Example:** For a Notion node requiring a database ID:
```
PARAMETERIZE:
- databaseId: Your Notion task database
  Find: In URL when viewing database (notion.so/{workspace}/{DATABASE_ID}?v=...)
```

This results in the install modal showing:
- **Label:** "Your Notion task database"
- **Placeholder:** Example database ID
- **Helper text:** "In URL when viewing database (notion.so/{workspace}/{DATABASE_ID}?v=...)"

**What to Document:**
- Database/calendar/project IDs
- API endpoints with user-specific paths
- Resource identifiers from dropdown selections (`__rl` fields)
- Any value that varies per user's setup

#### 6. Write the README

- Show example voice triggers
- Explain what the tool does
- List requirements
- Include an example of what CAAL says in response

#### 7. Validate Locally

```bash
node scripts/validate.js tools/media/my-awesome-tool
node scripts/check-secrets.js tools/media/my-awesome-tool/workflow.json
```

#### 8. Submit PR

```bash
git checkout -b add-my-awesome-tool
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my-awesome-tool"
git push origin add-my-awesome-tool
```

Open a PR. The review process will:
1. Validate your submission structure
2. Check for hardcoded secrets
3. Review for voice-friendliness
4. Post feedback as PR comments

## Quality Standards

Your tool must:

- [ ] Have a webhook trigger with description in notes
- [ ] Include at least 2 voice trigger examples
- [ ] Return voice-friendly responses (not raw JSON)
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- [ ] Not contain hardcoded secrets or user-specific URLs
- [ ] Complete in under 5 seconds for good voice UX

## Voice-First Design Principles

1. **Speak naturally** - Triggers should be how people actually talk
2. **Be concise** - Voice responses should be brief and scannable by ear
3. **Handle ambiguity** - Multiple ways to ask for the same thing
4. **Fail gracefully** - Error messages should be helpful, not technical
